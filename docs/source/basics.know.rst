What you need to know
*********************

In this section, we will cover what programming knowledge you will need in order to use CHAINS or some of its main scripts by introducing you to some great tutorials that can teach you all about it.

About your jobs and your job scheduler
======================================

First things first, it is important to clarify what CHAINS *does not do*. CHAINS cannot help you in figuring out how to run calculations with your programs, or how to build input files for them. CHAINS (and its main scripts) can help you automate that process, but it cannot guess what it is supposed to do. Start by defining what your methodology is and what it implies. Read the documentation of your programs as well as the one for your job scheduler or cluster. Once you know what to do and how to do it manually, it is time to automate it in order to process more jobs more quickly!

About Python
============

Python 3.5 is the main language of CHAINS. If you just want to use the scripts without customizing them, a beginner's knowledge of Python should be more than enough. Otherwise, you might need to delve just a bit deeper into that language, although we tried to stick with the basics as much as possible. If some lines of code use anything a bit unusual, a link is usually given in the comments for reference.

In order to learn Python, here is a YouTube tutorials playlist made by Corey Schafer:

| 
| As far as written tutorials go, the Python Guru `website <https://thepythonguru.com/>`_ offers some great ones, as does `TutorialsTeacher <https://www.tutorialsteacher.com/python>`_. The `official documentation <https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/index.html>`_ is also quite complete. For French speakers, OpenClassRooms constitutes `a great option <https://openclassrooms.com/fr/courses/235344-apprenez-a-programmer-en-python>`_.

Pay a special attention to **Python dictionaries**, as they will be the main focus of the work you will need to do in order to use CHAINS and its main scripts.

About YAML
==========

YAML_ is a "human friendly data serialization standard for all programming languages". (quote from the official website)

Here is a small YouTube tutorial made by Mike Dane that will cover the basics of the YAML syntax:

| With that, you know everything you need to know about YAML in order to use CHAINS! YAML is used here for the configuration files, containing all the parameters needed for the different scripts and calculations. As you may have seen in the video, the way those files are structured makes them very easy to use and to understand.

About Jinja2
============

"Jinja_ is a modern and designer-friendly templating language for Python, modelled after Djangoâ€™s templates. It is fast, widely used and secure with the optional sandboxed template execution environment." (quote from the official website)

Here is a small YouTube tutorial made by Jason Rigden that will cover the basics of the Jinja2 templating engine:

With that, you know everything you need to know about Jinja2 in order to use CHAINS! We use the Jinja language to create templates for the input files needed by ORCA_, Q-CHEM_ and QOCT-RA_. We also use it for the job scripts, containing all instructions for the job scheduler (SLURM_ for the CECI clusters). As you may have seen in the video, the Jinja language offers a relatively easy and intuitive way of creating those templates, which makes it easier to adapt the templates to pretty much any input files for any ab initio program such as Gaussian_ or Molpro_, and any other job scheduler such as Torque_.

About Regular Expressions
=========================

`Regular Expressions`_ (or regexes) are a powerful tool that can define search patterns to look for specific information in text. You don't need to know how they work to simply use ``ABIN LAUNCHER`` or ``CONTROL LAUNCHER``, but they are used in the results treatment part of CHAINS. If you want to customize the treatment of your results, or if you want to define new scanning functions for :doc:`geometry files <abin_launcher.scan>` (in ``ABIN LAUNCHER``) or program output files (in ``CONTROL LAUNCHER``), it is probably a good idea to take a look at how they work.

Regular Expressions can present themselves as incredibly unintuitive but their versatility certainly makes up for that. Here is a YouTube tutorial made by Corey Schafer that will cover how regexes work and how they can be used in Python:
